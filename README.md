## Effect of Drunk driving laws on Traffic deaths ( Time Series Analysis)


Project descriptionUsing a panel data of 48 states of United States from 1982 â€“ 1988 and an extensive set of control variables,
we analyzed the impact of socio-economic factors, political factors, laws, and regulations on traffic fatalities.

Preliminary Analysis is performed using tableau to evaluate the trend of fatality rates, Beer tax across all states during 1982-1988.
From the analysis of the correlation matrix of data, we found a high correlation among total fatality rate, alcohol fatality rates, 
and nighttime fatality rate so we had to run separate models for all the fatality rates. Pooled OLS model, Time Fixed model,
Random effects model are evaluated to validate formed hypotheses.
